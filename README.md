# Cooperation in an Adversarial Multi-Agent Game

- Our ambition with this project was to explore how independent
agents can learn to cooperate and work as a team to achieve a com-
mon goal. A multi-agent game with two teams competing against
each other through the use of reinforcement learning provides us
an environment where we are able to test and analyse the strategies
and cooperation methods developed by each team. Multiple games
could fulfil this purpose, but the game we ended up choosing was
a simplified version of "hide and seek" in a 2D squared board in
which two teams (one hiding and one seeking) compete against
each other. Moreover though the use of a dynamic board and team
size with this project we plan to study the scalability in cooperative
behaviour and in learning. Finally, by implementing obstacles in
the board we want to analyse how agents deal with a variable envi-
ronment and their ability to deal and cooperate through adversity.
David will create the virtual environment. Jo√£o will create the rules
for the environment and the agents, and Rafael will apply learning
algorithms to the agents.

- You can run episodes with different kinds of agents by going into the "randomVsRandom", "randomAndGreedy",
"socialConventionAndGreedy", "neuralAndGreedyAndRandom" files and running the tests
